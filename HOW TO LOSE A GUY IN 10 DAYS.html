            <ul>
                <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Be overly clingy! Text him constantly and demand his attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Introduce him to your crazy side. Share way too much personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Plan a surprise date. Make sure it‚Äôs totally uncomfortable for him.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 4:</strong> Talk about your future together. A lot. Too much.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> Start picking out wedding songs... it‚Äôs only day 5, right?</li>
                <li><strong>Day 6:</strong> Show up at his work uninvited. Bring lunch. And dessert. And a band.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 7:</strong> Be hyper-jealous. Over everything. Even his cat.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 8:</strong> Introduce him to your mom. And your grandma. And your aunt. And the neighbors.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 9:</strong> Plan a dinner with his friends. Overly discuss your relationship in front of them.</li>
                <li><strong>Day 10:</strong> Demand exclusivity‚Ä¶ immediately. Don‚Äôt give him a chance to breathe.</li>
            </ul>
